title: "Suboptimal humans: where neuroscience and economics can inform each other"
published: false

I've been thinking about starting a blog for a bit, so here it goes!

A monumental challenge in economics research is the incorporation of the (apparent) irrationality of human behavior into
informative models of the exchange of goods and services. The fields of economics and psychology have always had a
natural overlap, since this suboptimal behavior ultimately arises from the cognitive processes of humans interacting in
the marketplace.  Recently, economists have started to dig deeper by looking to neuroscience for a mechanistic understanding of this suboptimal behavior.  In turn, neuroscientists are realizing that many of the classic formalisms and tools from economics research, may be useful for understanding neural computation.  This atmosphere of mutual intrigue motivated the “Workshop on Efficient Coding and Resource-Limited Cognition” this past Friday, organized by the Columbia Economics Department held in the Jerome L. Greene Science Center, which houses Columbia’s Neuroscience Department.  The idea of the title is that in the brain, there is a need for efficient coding of information in neural representations in such a biologically resource-limited setting (finite energy, finite neurons, temporal constraints, etc.)
In this post, I’ll summarize the main ideas from the talks and discussion panels from the perspective of a graduate student studying theoretical neuroscience.
